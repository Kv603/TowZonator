Smarter "Tow Zone" sign

The most common excuse we here from people parking in our reserved spaces, blocking our loading dock and garage bay, are "It's the weekend, I didn't know you were open!".   So we created this high-visibility but ordinance-compliant sign to ensure violators cannot claim ignorance when they are towed.

First prototype uses 24VDC LED strips from a "retired" LCD television:
